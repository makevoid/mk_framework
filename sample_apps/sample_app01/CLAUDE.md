# MK Framework Guidelines

## Commands
- Run server: `bundle exec rackup`
- Install dependencies: `bundle install`
- Run tests: `bundle exec rspec`
- Run single test: `bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/file_spec.rb:LINE_NUMBER`
- Linting: `bundle exec rubocop`

## Code Style
- Include `# frozen_string_literal: true` at the top of each Ruby file
- Follow Ruby naming conventions: snake_case for methods/variables, CamelCase for classes
- RESTful architecture with controller/handler separation
- Controllers handle data retrieval and business logic
- Handlers handle response formatting and HTTP status
- Models use Sequel::Model with validation_helpers plugin
- Error handling: use r.halt for interrupting execution, handlers for formatting errors
- Resource routing follows RESTful convention (index, show, create, update, delete)
- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Explicit requires over autoloading
- Use fetch for required parameters, direct access for optional ones
